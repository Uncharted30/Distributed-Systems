### Suppose we have the scenario shown in the Raft paper's Figure 7: a cluster of seven servers, with the log contents shown. The first server crashes (the one at the top of the figure), and cannot be contacted. A leader election ensues. For each of the servers marked (a), (d), and (f), could that server be elected? If yes, which servers would vote for it? If no, what specific Raft mechanism(s) would prevent it from being elected?

(a) could be elected. (a) (b), (e) and (f) would vote for (a), it is 4 votes in total, so (a) could become a leader.

(d) could be elected. All servers would vote for (d).

(f) could not be elected. A server need votes from majority of servers in the cluster to be elected. But (f) can only get 1 vote from itself. Other servers would not grant (f) votes because (f)'s log entries are less up-to-date.
