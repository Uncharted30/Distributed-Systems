### Could a received InstallSnapshot RPC cause the state machine to go backwards in time? That is, could step 8 in Figure 13 cause the state machine to be reset so that it reflects fewer executed operations? If yes, explain how this could happen. If no, explain why it can't happen.

No, this will not happen. Because the leader must contains all committed logs if it could be elected as a leader. Therefore the snapshot it creates must be a prefix of all committed logs. If a server receives a snapshot contains log entries that is not in it own log, the server does not contain all committed logs, so the snapshot won't cause it go backwards in time. If a server receives a snapshot describes a prefix of its own log, it just deletes logs covered by this snapshot, but won't change its own state, so the snapshot won't cause it go backwards in time.
